# U-Develop-It
Module 12 | Project 10 | U Vote It

## Description
A simple, text-based RPG created as an introduction to Node.js, test-driven development, and object-oriented programming. A command-line role-playing game (RPG) in which the user battles a series of enemies whose health and stats can be sustained by taking a potion. The game creates new objects using JavaScript constructor functions, and also implements basic code tests using the Jest framework.

## Scenario
The local zoo has received funding to build a new online catalog, and they've asked you to create a web server for a front-end application they’re developing, called Zoo Keepr. This site’s data will be stored on the server you create. This will allow animal enthusiasts to access the data from different locations and browsers without needing to download it to their device.
